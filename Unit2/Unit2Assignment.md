## Characteristics of big data and cloud computing
## What is Blockchain?
- Blockchain is basically like a huge data ledger. Meaning it keeps track of data transactions all over the place. It’s most known for its use in cryptocurrency systems since the whole point of it is to have a decentralized transaction record. The main difference with a “normal” database is that the information is managed by blocks, and they can be chained together, so if you want to add data, you just add a block on top of the previous one. So, instead of tables, you have blocks put together.
## What is Hyperledger?
- Hyperledger is what we would define as a framework for blockchain. It’s a project developed by Linux which allows developers to build blockchain networks and applications. A curious thing to notice is that the director stated that they didn’t wish to pursue a currency. This way they don’t have to face more political challenges. The basis of Hyperledger seems to be a “please get into blockchain, this is the future” kind of deal. It’s enthusiast that aren’t attached to a particular cryptocurrency but are in love with the idea of blockchain.
## Financial transactions
A transaction is an operation carried out between two parties, which involves the exchange between a good or service and a certain amount. Therefore, the concept of transaction is applied for economic operations in which money is used to pay for a purchased product. In this sense, the meaning of the concept is reduced to the transaction between buyer and seller where money is somehow involved. When we talk about financial transactions at the business level, we refer to the change in the value of the assets, liabilities or capital stock of an entity. Basically this term has a great impact on the economy since it is what moves it, without transactions there is no economy, transaction as mentioned above, means exchange, which is what makes the economy move through exchange of goods.
## Digital currencies
This is a type of currency in digital form which has been issued by a central bank and which is a digital representation of fiat money. It therefore has the property of being a form of money that is regulated by a state or by a union of states.
### Advantages
- Creation of more efficient payment systems, and issuance and control of fund issuance mechanisms. Elements that the current economic system does not allow to carry out.
- They could bring greater financial inclusion for the users of a state. 
- It would bring greater competition between payment companies, allow commission adjustments and downward rates.

They are a means of exchange that can only be arranged and used electronically, through wallets (e-Wallet) connected to an internet network. A digital currency can exist in a decentralized way or regulated by a central institution.

## Technical obstacles and political challenges
It is true that today the economy has evolved along with technology, that is, today it is very common to see more payments digitally than in cash and this is thanks to the emerging exchange of digital currencies, as we have already seen, it is basically a currency that is backed by a bank and today in our own phones we have those currencies. All this has emerged in recent years but it also has several obstacles, for example, lately since it is all digital, currencies are more likely to be methods of these, “Scammers use Google ads to steal thousands of dollars of wallets ”, on the other hand there are countries that seek“ legal support ”to convert digital currencies into a payment method if, like the savior who recently chose to make bitcoin their national currency, there are people who are already starting to prefer this type of currency to cash, such as payment of wages through bitcoins. It must be emphasized that bitcoin is a digital currency, only that it is not regulated or backed by a bank. In summary, the digital currency and everything related to the digital economy has many blocks and covers many issues in politics since it is a transition of everything we know to the cloud and more obstacles and more changes will arise in the countries.
