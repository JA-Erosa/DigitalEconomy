## What is Blockchain?
- Blockchain is basically like a huge data ledger. Meaning it keeps track of data transactions all over the place. It’s most known for its use in cryptocurrency systems since the whole point of it is to have a decentralized transaction record. The main difference with a “normal” database is that the information is managed by blocks, and they can be chained together, so if you want to add data, you just add a block on top of the previous one. So, instead of tables, you have blocks put together.
## What is Hyperledger?
- Hyperledger is what we would define as a framework for blockchain. It’s a project developed by Linux which allows developers to build blockchain networks and applications. A curious thing to notice is that the director stated that they didn’t wish to pursue a currency. This way they don’t have to face more political challenges. The basis of Hyperledger seems to be a “please get into blockchain, this is the future” kind of deal. It’s enthusiast that aren’t attached to a particular cryptocurrency but are in love with the idea of blockchain.
